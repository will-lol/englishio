Intro. Global issue: “social inequality between Greater Middle Eastern asylum seekers and citizens of developed states”
“Social inequality between Greater Middle Eastern asylum seekers and citizens of developed states” is a global issue that Arnold Zable examines in a number of his works. The ‘SIEV X’ incident is the subject of two of his short stories, “The Ancient Mariner” (in which my passage lies) and *Zahra’s Lullaby*. 

In his greater body of work, Arnold Zable has written two short stories with a specific focus on the global issue. The first, in which my passage lies, is “The Ancient Mariner” from the collection *Violin Lessons* and the second is “Zahra’s Lullaby” from *A Country Too Far*. The audiences for both stories are globally-minded middle to upper-class voting Australians who possess the ability to influence change. And both “The Ancient Mariner” and “Zahra’s Lullaby” are stories set in modern-day Australia where Zable talks to a SIEV X survivor and former citizen of the Greater Middle East about their experiences. In “Zahra’s Lullaby”, Zable heavily emphasises husband and wife and survivors of SIEV X, Faris and Majida’s apartment and its normalities. Significant to this is the inclusion of details such as “Whenever I visit there is food on the coffee table” or that the “flat is clean and neat”. In contrast, Zable explains the conditions of the boat that took them across the Indian Ocean, “the ageing fishing vessel bore no resemblance to [a spacious, well-equipped boat]”. In a similar vein, “The Ancient Mariner” also explores this contrast for Amal Basry, where in her apartment, Zable remarks on a “CD of Umm Khultum”, “her cooking” and “cardamon tea”. In her asylum seeker state, however, Amal remarks: “There was no food and no medicine”, and “our food is ‘air food’, like nothing”. This contrast is emblematic of the global issue. Themes of *limbo* or *statelessness*, especially concerning asylum seekers, are heavily explored in both “Zahra’s Lullaby” and “The Ancient Mariner”. In the “Ancient Mariner”, Zable likens “limbo” to a “state worse than death” while simultaneously implying that asylum seekers exist in this state. “Statelessness” is diction that is repeated throughout “Zahra’s Lullaby” that, being used by the United Nations, is a term with official and legal connotations. In emphasising “limbo” and “statelessness”, Zable draws a juxtaposition between the audience and the present status of Amal, Faris and Majida, which is stateful. This juxtaposition enhances the global issue.
 
My passage presents the global issue thoroughly. Throughout “The Ancient Mariner”, Zable includes large quotes from Amal, occasionally interjecting to emphasise or otherwise provide context. This structure allows Zable to preserve the mood of his interactions with Amal in their transposition from speech to written story. In this passage, this preservation enhances the global issue by invigorating Amal’s story. And in addition, the empathetic mood in this passage allows the audience to contrast their own experience with Amal’s, furthering the global issue in a poignant way. To achieve this, Zable uses auditory imagery and musical diction through lines 1 to 13. Zable compares Amal to Umm Khultum, an Arab singer who composes extended songs that tell stories. Zable describes Amal’s recounting as an “incantation”, an interesting use of diction that positions Amal’s telling as spiritual or religious (by the connotation) but also infectious (by the denotation). Zable’s uses  “*tarab*” on line 11, a word used specifically for Arabic music to mean, according to the Michigan Daily, “enchantment”. Ultimately, the effect of this musical diction and comparison to Umm Khultum, is for Zable to share his deep investment in Amal’s story with the audience, allowing them to empathise with it. The representation of the global issue continues as the passage shifts to Amal’s words. In her opening line, linse 15, Amal addresses Zable and the reader as ’My brother’. In doing so, Amal establishes the reader as a brother, which in Islam is less a familial relation than an indication of trust and respect. The effect of this is to further that empathetic mood. In a use of anaphora on lines 19 to 21, Amal repeats ’they said’ at the begninning of clauses. The effect of this is to emphasise her final sentence, “They said that Australia is a democratic country”. This sentence strongly emphasises the global issue, in that reasons for seeking asylum often stem from corruption or authoritarian rule. In the following paragraph, Amal speaks about her ’dreams’ of Australia. The content of this paragraph clearly displays the global issue, in that she dreams to be Australian becuase Australian’s enjoy greater welfare than she does as an asylum seeker. My passage presents the global issue through its content, especially within Amal's quotes which are enhanced by Zable's interjection.
